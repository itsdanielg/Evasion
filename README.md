# Evasion
An auto-scrolling, mouse-based game created in JavaFX during the summer of 2017.
The objective of the game is to avoid collision with falling, random-number generated obstacles.
This game heavily utilizes the concept of using key frames, timelines, object collisions, and array memory allocation in order to create a non-demanding indie game.
